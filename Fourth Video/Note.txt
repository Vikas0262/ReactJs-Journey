Passing props to component is similar like passing argument to a function.

Never keep any hardcoded string in component file (like image path), hardcoded string send in util folder.

There are two type export and two type import:
1- Default export/Import
export defalut componentName or Variable name;
import component from 'path';

2- Named export/Import
export const component;
import {component} from 'path';


When you need to export multiple thing in one file we do named export.

ReactElement => Plain JavaScript Object.

Hooks => Just a normal js function, that function write such prebuilt logic 
1- useState => whenever state variable update, react triggers a reconcilation cycle(re-render)
2- useEffect => useEffect called after the render, its making re-render   



fetch() => This function given by browser engine it is used to fetch data

optional Chaining =>


Never Keep any hardcoded data in app.js file everything put in utils folder and used variable making


whenever state varibale changes react re-render my components

react only good in dom manipulation

react uses reconcilation algorithim is also known as react fiber

virtual dom is a represantation of actual dom

react fiber architecture is algorithim of react

react doing effiecent dom manipulation because this is fast

Monolithic architecture =>
Microservice architecture => 


Ther are two approch how data fetched from the backend
1) Load - API - render
2) Load - render - API - rerender
2nd approch batter

CROS =>

Shimmar UI => we create fake data or fake cards until Api not loaded making ui batter
we make fake ui experince so user can not say website is slow or taking much time
