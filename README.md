## 🚀 Getting Started

To run any of these projects locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ReactJs-Journey.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd ReactJs-Journey/project-name
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## 📝 Notes

### Important Learnings
1. **State Management**: 
   - Use local state for component-specific data
   - Context API is great for global state that doesn't change often
   - Redux Toolkit is powerful for complex state management needs

2. **Best Practices**:
   - Keep components small and focused
   - Use custom hooks for reusable logic
   - Always add proper PropTypes or TypeScript types
   - Write tests for your components

3. **Performance Tips**:
   - Use React.memo for expensive renders
   - Implement code splitting for larger applications
   - Use the production build for deployment
